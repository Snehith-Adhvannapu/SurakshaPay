# Rural Banking Cybersecurity Framework - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach Documentation

**Selected Approach:** Design System Approach (Material Design) with accessibility adaptations
**Justification:** Given the utility-focused nature, information-dense content, and need for consistency across low-end devices, Material Design provides the structured, accessible foundation required for rural users with minimal technical literacy.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Ultra-lightweight design optimized for 1-2GB RAM devices
- Maximum accessibility for users with minimal technical literacy
- Clear visual security indicators and fraud alerts
- Progressive enhancement for varying connectivity levels

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light Mode: 210 100% 25% (Deep blue for trust and security)
- Dark Mode: 210 80% 15% (Darker blue variant)

**Secondary Colors:**
- Success/Safe: 120 70% 35% (Forest green)
- Warning/Caution: 35 85% 50% (Amber)
- Error/Danger: 0 75% 45% (Red)
- Neutral: 220 15% 95% (Light gray)

**Security Status Colors:**
- Verified/Secure: 150 60% 40% (Teal green)
- Pending Verification: 45 90% 55% (Yellow)
- Security Alert: 15 85% 50% (Orange-red)

### B. Typography
**Font Family:** Roboto (Google Fonts CDN)
**Hierarchy:**
- Headlines: Roboto Medium, 24px/28px
- Body Text: Roboto Regular, 16px/24px (larger for accessibility)
- Captions: Roboto Regular, 14px/20px
- Security Alerts: Roboto Medium, 18px/24px

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8 (p-2, m-4, gap-6, h-8)
**Grid:** Single column layout with maximum 2-column sections for larger screens
**Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px height for all interactive elements

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Bottom navigation bar with 4 primary actions
- Large, clearly labeled icons with text
- Persistent security status indicator

**Security Components:**
- Transaction verification cards with clear approve/deny buttons
- Fraud alert banners with high contrast colors
- Security status badges using color and icon combinations
- Authentication prompts with step-by-step guidance

**Forms:**
- Large input fields with clear labels
- PIN entry with secure masking
- Progress indicators for multi-step authentication
- Error states with helpful guidance text

**Data Displays:**
- Transaction history with security indicators
- Account balance with verification badges
- Simple charts for spending patterns (fraud detection)

**Overlays:**
- Security education modals with illustrations
- Transaction confirmation dialogs
- Fraud alert notifications

### E. Accessibility & Performance Features

**Visual Indicators:**
- High contrast color combinations (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- Icon + text + color combinations for security states
- Large touch targets and generous spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy with consistent styling

**Offline Capabilities:**
- Cached interface elements
- Offline transaction queue with clear status indicators
- Progressive loading with skeleton screens

**Security UX:**
- Clear "this is secure" vs "this needs attention" visual language
- Simple, non-technical language for all security prompts
- Visual confirmation for successful security actions
- Educational tooltips for security features

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Minimal animations (loading spinners and success checkmarks only)
- Optimized images and icons under 1MB total app size
- Progressive enhancement for slower networks
- Efficient component rendering for low-RAM devices

This design system prioritizes trust, clarity, and accessibility while maintaining the lightweight performance requirements essential for rural banking users on low-end devices.
